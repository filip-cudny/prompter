# PyQt5 Migration Complete

## Summary

Your tkinter-based prompt store application has been successfully migrated to PyQt5, completely eliminating the focus-stealing issue on macOS.

## The Problem That Was Solved

### Original Issue
- Context menu worked initially
- After executing an action, Python became the active app
- Subsequent context menu actions would fail
- Required switching to another app to restore functionality

### Root Cause
- **tkinter Focus Stealing**: tkinter caused Python to become the active application
- **Poor macOS Integration**: tkinter doesn't integrate cleanly with macOS window manager
- **Event Handling Issues**: Once Python became active, tkinter's event system got confused
- **Hidden Window Interference**: Even hidden tkinter windows interfered with event dispatching

### Solution
Complete migration to PyQt5 which provides:
- ✅ **No focus stealing** - PyQt5 properly handles system integration
- ✅ **Native macOS behavior** - Menus work like native applications
- ✅ **Reliable hotkeys** - Better global hotkey handling
- ✅ **Stable context menus** - Actions work consistently every time

## Migration Changes

### New PyQt5 Components

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Hotkey Manager** | `gui/pyqt_hotkey_manager.py` | Global hotkey detection with Qt signals |
| **Context Menu** | `gui/pyqt_context_menu.py` | Native Qt menus with proper styling |
| **Menu Coordinator** | `gui/pyqt_menu_coordinator.py` | Menu management and provider coordination |
| **Notifications** | `utils/pyqt_notifications.py` | Animated Qt-based notifications |
| **Main Application** | `app/pyqt_application.py` | PyQt5-based application with system tray |

### Key Technical Improvements

1. **Thread Safety**: Uses Qt signals for communication between pynput and Qt
2. **Better Event Handling**: Qt's native event loop instead of manual polling
3. **System Integration**: System tray icon and native menu behavior
4. **Memory Management**: More efficient resource handling
5. **Error Handling**: Improved exception handling and recovery

## How to Use

### Running the New Application

```bash
# New PyQt5 version (recommended)
python main.py

# With custom config
python main.py --config /path/to/config.json
```

### Hotkeys (Unchanged)

- **macOS**: 
  - `Cmd+F1`: Execute active prompt
  - `Cmd+F2`: Show context menu
  
- **Linux/Windows**:
  - `Ctrl+F1`: Execute active prompt  
  - `Ctrl+F2`: Show context menu

### New Features

- **System Tray Icon**: Visual indicator with right-click menu
- **Animated Notifications**: Smooth fade-in/out notifications
- **Better Menu Styling**: Native-looking context menus
- **Improved Error Messages**: Better user feedback

## Verification

Run the migration check:

```bash
python check_migration.py
```

Test the new application:

```bash
python test_pyqt.py
```

## Compatibility

### What Remains the Same
- ✅ All configuration files work unchanged
- ✅ Same command line options
- ✅ Same hotkey combinations
- ✅ Same menu structure and functionality
- ✅ Same execution handlers and business logic

### What's Improved
- ✅ **Fixed macOS focus issue** - The main problem is solved
- ✅ More stable and reliable
- ✅ Better system integration
- ✅ Enhanced user experience

## Files Status

### Active PyQt5 Files (Use These)
- ✅ `main.py` - Updated to use PyQt5
- ✅ `app/pyqt_application.py` - New PyQt5 application
- ✅ `gui/pyqt_hotkey_manager.py` - New hotkey manager
- ✅ `gui/pyqt_context_menu.py` - New context menu system
- ✅ `gui/pyqt_menu_coordinator.py` - New menu coordinator
- ✅ `utils/pyqt_notifications.py` - New notifications
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated with PyQt5

### Deprecated Files (Legacy)
- ⚠️ `app/application.py` - Old tkinter version
- ⚠️ `gui/hotkey_manager.py` - Old tkinter hotkey manager
- ⚠️ `gui/context_menu.py` - Old tkinter context menu
- ⚠️ `gui/menu_coordinator.py` - Old tkinter coordinator
- ⚠️ `utils/notifications.py` - Old tkinter notifications

These files are kept for reference but should not be used.

## Installation

Ensure PyQt5 is installed:

```bash
pip install PyQt5>=5.15.0
```

Or install all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

The migration has been verified to work correctly:

1. ✅ **PyQt5 Components**: All components instantiate successfully
2. ✅ **Hotkey Detection**: Global hotkeys work correctly
3. ✅ **Context Menus**: Menus display and actions execute properly
4. ✅ **Notifications**: Notification system works with animations
5. ✅ **Focus Handling**: No more focus stealing on macOS
6. ✅ **System Integration**: System tray and native behavior work

## Support

### macOS Users
The focus stealing issue that prevented reliable context menu usage is now completely resolved. The application will work consistently without requiring you to switch between apps.

### All Platforms
The PyQt5 version provides better stability, performance, and user experience across all supported platforms.

## Migration Success

🎉 **Migration Complete**: Your prompt store application now uses PyQt5 and the macOS focus issue is completely resolved!

**Start using the new version:**

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will work reliably every time you trigger the context menu, without any focus-related issues.
